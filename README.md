Initial work is happening in https://github.com/servirtium/demo-python-climate-data-tck and when more viable than 
it is now, a library will be extracted from that demo and put in here for further work.

Help needed methodically working on that demo, then refactoring it to have a library in this repo - email paul@hammant.org (or get engaged the modern way: in issues and pull-requests)
