A Servirtium library for Python.  

Working:

* Record and playback of GET

Not Working yet:

* Any support for POST, PUT etc.

Demo project that uses it: https://github.com/servirtium/demo-python-climate-data-tck 

Help needed from Pythonistas!

## Building Servirtium

Execute the following commands to install the package locally:

```
cd servirtium-python
pip3 install -e .
```

The 'demo-python-climate-data-tck' demo needs you to have built the Python Servirtium 
first as it is unpublished in pip-land.
